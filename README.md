# Interpr3t
 
This is a project that I am currently working on.

I like to start my day by reading the bible, but I want to bounce back and forth between versions to understand the word ✝️ better. THEREFORE, this app will use simple web scraping and one search bar that can pull up three different tabs to 3 different versions interpretations, hence named it interpr3t!
